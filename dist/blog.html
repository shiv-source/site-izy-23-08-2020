                                        Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through dependency injection (DI).
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Modules</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Every Angular app has a root module, conventionally named AppModule, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An app typically contains many functional modules
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be exported and used by other NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the Router NgModule.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing development of complex applications, and in designing for reusability. In addition, this technique lets you take advantage of lazy-loading—that is, loading modules on demand—to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Components</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy with the page document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The @Component() decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides the template and related component-specific metadata.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Templates, directives, and data binding</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements before they are displayed. Template directives provide program logic, and binding markup connects your application data and the DOM. There are two types of data binding:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Event binding lets your app respond to user input in the target environment by updating your application data.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Property binding lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application data into the HTML.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Before a view is displayed, Angular evaluates the directives and resolves the binding syntax in the template to modify the HTML elements and the DOM, according to your program data and logic. Angular supports two-way data binding, meaning that changes in the DOM, such as user choices, are also reflected in your program data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your templates can use pipes to improve the user experience by transforming values for display. For example, use pipes to display dates and currency values that are appropriate for a user's locale. Angular provides predefined pipes for common transformations, and you can also define your own pipes.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Services and dependency injection</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        For data or logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you create a service class. A service class definition is immediately preceded by the @Injectable() decorator. The decorator provides the metadata that allows other providers to be injected as dependencies into your class.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Dependency injection (DI) lets you keep your component classes lean and efficient. They don't fetch data from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the console; they delegate such tasks to services.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Routing</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The Angular Router NgModule provides a service that lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your app. It is modeled on the familiar browser navigation conventions:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Enter a URL in the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Click links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Click the browser's back and forward buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages you've seen.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        The router maps URL-like paths to views instead of pages. When a user performs an action, such as clicking a link, that would load a new page in the browser, the router intercepts the browser's behavior, and shows or hides view hierarchies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If the router determines that the current application state requires particular functionality, and the module that defines it hasn't been loaded, the router can lazy-load the module on demand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The router interprets a link URL according to your app's view navigation rules and data state. You can navigate to new views when the user clicks a button or selects from a drop box, or in response to some other stimulus from any source. The router logs activity in the browser's history, so the back and forward buttons work as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To define navigation rules, you associate navigation paths with your components. A path uses a URL-like syntax that integrates your program data, in much the same way that template syntax integrates your views with your program data. You can then apply program logic to choose which views to show or to hide, in response to user input and your own access rules.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>An introduction to the React view library</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used apps, powering Facebook and Instagram among countless other applications.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Is React simple to learn?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Even though I said that React is simpler than alternative frameworks, diving into React is still complicated, but mostly because of the corollary technologies that can be integrated with React, like Redux and GraphQL.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        React in itself has a very small API, and you basically need to understand 4 concepts to get started:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Components</li>
                                        <li>JSX</li>
                                        <li>State</li>
                                        <li>Props</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>How to install React on your development computer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        React is a library, so saying install might sound a bit weird. Maybe setup is a better word, but you get the concept.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are various ways to setup React so that it can be used on your app or site.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Load React directly in the web page</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The simplest one is to add the React JavaScript file into the page directly. This is best when your React app will interact with the elements present on a single page, and not actually controls the whole navigation aspect.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In this case, you add 2 script tags to the end of the <span>body</span> tag:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Here we loaded both React and React DOM. Why 2 libraries? Because React is 100% independent from the browser and can be used outside it (for example on Mobile devices with React Native). Hence the need for React DOM, to add the wrappers for the browser.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After those tags you can load your JavaScript files that use React, or even inline JavaScript in a <span>script</span> tag:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>To use JSX you need an extra step: load Babel</p>
                                    <p>
                                        and load your scripts with the special <span>text/babel</span> MIME type:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now you can add JSX in your app.js file:
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Using <span>var</span></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Until ES2015, <span>var</span> was the only construct available for defining variables.
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="full-width code-demo">var a = 0</span>
                                    <p>
                                        If you forget to add <span>var</span> you will be assigning a value to an undeclared variable, and the results might vary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If you don’t initialize the variable when you declare it, it will have the <span>undefined</span> value until you assign a value to it.
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="full-width code-demo">var a //typeof a === 'undefined'</span>
                                    <p>
                                        You can redeclare the variable many times, overriding it:
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="full-width code-demo">
                                        <span class="full-width">var a = 1</span>
                                        <span class="full-width">var a = 2</span>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>
                                        You can also declare multiple variables at once in the same statement:
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="full-width code-demo">
                                        var a = 1, b = 2jsx
                                    </span>
                                    <h4>Using <span>let</span></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <span>Let</span> is a new feature introduced in ES2015 and it's essentially a block scoped version of <span>var</span>. Its scope is limited to the block, statement or expression where it's defined, and all the contained inner blocks.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Using <span>const</span></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Variables declared with <span>var</span> or <span>let</span> can be changed later on in the program, and reassigned. Once a <span>const</span> is initialized, its value can never be changed again, and it can't be reassigned to a different value.
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="full-width code-demo">
                                        const a = 'test'
                                    </span>
                                    <h4>Arrow functions</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 / ECMAScript 2015, and since their introduction they changed forever how JavaScript code looks (and works).
                                    </p>
